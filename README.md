# Sport Tap mobile app prototype

This is a prototype mobile app built on [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com). A friend of mine and I were
considering founding a startup with the aim of making it easier for friends to organize sports events and workouts together.
Unfortunately, we lost momentum due to a lack of initial funds and time conflicts. However, it was a good opportunity for me
to learn a number of modern technologies.

The initial goal was to target Android and iOS so I started with **Ionic** ([Angular 1](https://angularjs.org)),
but over time migrated UI to [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org)

I also switched to **Typescript**, [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs), and a [substantial build system based on gulp](https://github.com/MaximAbramchuck/angular-gulp-ionic-boilerplate)
that uses webdriver, wiredep, browser-sync, which I customized a bit for my project. Also CSS is generated using SASS.
For testing I initially looked at Karma, but after some configuration frustration switched to Mocha and Chai. 

I just began work on structuring the database with Firebase when work was suspended on this project.

# Seeking Employment

I am currently seeking employment and this project is uploaded primarily to demonstrate 
my ability to work with modern web application technology. See my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arlowhite)
